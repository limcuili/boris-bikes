Pairing Challenge #2

I'm pairing with Dani today! We aim to get at least 10 questions done in the challenge.

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.
